I recently had the pleasure to visit [OSCON](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-eu-2015) in Amsterdam on behalf of [Telerik](http://www.telerik.com/). The conference was focused mainly around the use and growth of open source projects. It was my first conference of such scale and I was thrilled to meet so many new people and technologies. In this post I wish to share with you a brief summary of some of the talks that I attended. Please read further should you find it interesting:

## The Seif Project
The conference started with [Douglas Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/) presenting the [Seif Project](http://seif.place/). Seif is a mix of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [QT](http://www.qt.io/) and a browser helper app and the point is to make **secure web applications**. There is no HTML/CSS involved, which in his opinion, is suboptimal because of all the workarounds and limitations of the web. Parts of the project include a random number generator using entropy from the microphone and camera, secure JSON over TCP, hash-based resource management instead of named locations and more. For more information about Seif be sure to watch the [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHRXPlq9XNw).

## Programming as Performance - Live Coding With Sonic Pi
According to Sam Aaron, a research associate at the University of Cambridge, the way to get the world interested in programming is not by introducing people to binary numbers and sorting algorithms, but to the beauty of music and code put together. [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) is a **music synthesizer written in Ruby and a way to get kids engaged in coding** (like Logo). It is available for Windows, Mac and Raspberry Pi so it's ideal for use in any classroom. Starting with some simple imperative commands to control the pitch and duration of each sound, you are able to compose almost any existing melody. To make the experience even better, there are live loops that allow you to edit the code while the music is executing and hear the new sounds. The [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENfyOndcvP0) was very enthusiastic and I highly recommend watching it. You can also hear some of the advanced samples on the [product site](http://sonic-pi.net/).

## 5* Non-Cryptographic Hash Functions Enter. One Hash Function Leaves.
This talk opened the world of non-cryptographic hash functions. When you only need to check if an element exists in a set or a hash table using a non-cryptographic hash functions is usually [faster and more memory efficient](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/11839/) than using a cryptographic one. It was interesting to see how different algorithms like [CRC-32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check), [FNV-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function), [MurmurHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash) behave on inputs of varying length and scale. The conclusion (as always) was to know your environment and to use what's best for you. You can find more details about the performance of each algorithm in the [slides](http://lawngnome.github.io/non-cryptographic-hashing/) (or this [Stack Overflow answer](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/145633/20012)).

## GET /Better
[In his talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77kSLoOWxYg), Mark Bates shared the secret how he got **from a security guard at a software company to a developer, speaker and book author**. Of course there isn't no magic pill, but a lot of hard work. His steps to becoming a better software engineer included practicing, networking and sharing. He shared his passion how people should be always interested in their work. Meeting up people on conferences or local groups is always a great start to build some connections and sharing with the world through a blog brings some more visibility to your work.

## Growth Hacking: Data and Product Driven Marketing
This was a fast-paced talk from the [Growth Tribe](http://www.growthtribe.io/) academy explaining what [growth hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking) is - a mix of **creative marketing, behavioral psychology and unconventional tactics**. Without proper distribution, no one will use your product - no matter how great it is. There are just too many new ideas and startups coming up each day. The speaker explained how there is a little bit of "evil" in the early days of many mainstream products. Through the use of a referral program for increased storage space or scraping [craigslist](http://craigslist.org/) for local rentals, [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) were able to outcompete their rivals. Not everything is subversiveness, though - A/B testing, predictive analysis, talking with clients and usability testing are just as important for a product. If this made you interested in growth hacking be sure to watch the [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajccEoAhfmc).

## Innersource as the Anti-Silo: How Open Source Style Has Broken Silos While Strengthening Systems at PayPal
This talk was an introduction by [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/) to [InnerSource](http://www.innersourcecommons.org/). **InnerSource is applying open source best practices to internal software**, even if it is not being planned to be published in the future. The PayPal checkout team, which handles one of the most complex and important processes, were spending 75% of their time rewriting hundred of thousands lines of code submitted by other teams. This was frustrating for them and they didn't have time for doing the things they wanted. The first thing that PayPal tried to fix things was to gather the lead developers from all the teams around the world together in one office for a couple of months. Supposedly this didn't go so well, because the other developers were left out of the process. So they looked at [how the open source community handles problems of such scale](https://community.apache.org/contributors/#from-contributor-to-committer) across languages, cultures and time zones. They adopted the pull request approach and designated a person of the checkout team whose whole responsibility was to review all incoming code. Through non-aggressive and constructive comments the percentage of code coming through pull requests went from 9% to 70% and the time spent rewriting others' code went to 0%. This proved how open source can stimulate collaboration and improve developer happiness even in enterprise software.

## Modelling Complex Game Economy With Neo4j
This talk was about the use of [graph databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database) in a [Facebook quest game](https://www.facebook.com/HereBeMonstersGame/) (discontinued). The speaker briefly showed how they used [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/) to **automatically balance thousands of codependent items, quests and recipes**. This prevents certain exploits when tweaking prices or drop rates and makes users paying real money feasible. For example a player should not be able to farm resources and resell crafted products at a cheaper price than the vendors. You can find more explanations from the author in his [in-depth post](https://www.airpair.com/neo4j/posts/modelling-game-economy-with-neo4j).

## Real-Time Music Recommendations With Storm
Another interesting talk was presented by [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/). The essence of the talk was using [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/) to offer users music recommendations by **reducing the processing time from 24 hours to a couple of minutes**. This is especially useful for first time visitors. To fine-tune their [machine learning algorithms](http://benanne.github.io/2014/08/05/spotify-cnns.html) they use [A/B testing](http://www.slideshare.net/MrChrisJohnson/algorithmic-music-recommendations-at-spotify/35). Given their large user sample (75 million active users, 20 million of which subscribers) they have a solid user basis for doing so. A track is taken into account only if the user has listened to it for at least 30 seconds or more and other songs from playlists in which this song appears (and any previously listened to) are picked for viable candidates.

## Secure Open Source: Making the Web Safer, One Codebase at a Time
The conference finished with an interesting initiative from [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/). They have an idea of extending the initial [Bug bounty program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_bounty_program) that they have introduced way back in the days of Netscape and that has become a common practice in securing modern software. [Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS)](https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS) is the name of the new award program and is all about **security-auditing from professional third-party consulting firms of [open source projects that Mozilla relies on](https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS/Projects_in_use_by_Mozilla) and getting in touch with the respective maintainers to fix them**. They are starting with $1,000,000 and the idea of the project is to prevent the next [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/) vulnerability. More info about MOSS can be found in the [announcing blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/10/23/mozilla-launches-open-source-support-program/).
