I've written a short blog post about running the [NativeScript Runtime for iOS](https://github.com/NativeScript/ios-runtime) on the new [Apple TV](https://developer.apple.com/tvos/). You can find it on the official blog at https://www.nativescript.org/blog/running-the-nativescript-runtime-for-ios-on-apple-tv.

There is also a sample app on GitHub: https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-tvOS.
